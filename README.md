This was my first self-coding experience in Python after finishing "Data Scienctist in Python" career path in Datacamp.
This was a 3 day open competition in Analytics Vidhya and I tried my best in a limited time period;
The data is not available anymore, so I don't prefer to share because it may object to copyrights, but I added my raw code;
Here is the original competition page;
